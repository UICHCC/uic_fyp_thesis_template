\section{Main  Text}
This section introduces the main text part. The main text is usually separated into several subsections. Chapter sections (Like Section 1, Section 2 and so on) should start at a new page.
\subsection{Flowchart}
\tikzstyle{decision} = [diamond, draw, fill=blue!20, 
    text width=4.5em, text badly centered, node distance=3cm, inner sep=0pt]
\tikzstyle{block} = [rectangle, draw, fill=blue!20, 
    text width=5em, text centered, rounded corners, minimum height=4em]
\tikzstyle{line} = [draw, -latex']
\tikzstyle{cloud} = [draw, ellipse,fill=red!20, node distance=3cm,
    minimum height=2em]
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 2cm, auto]
        % Place nodes
        \node [block] (init) {this};
        \node [block, below of=init] (identify) {is};
        \node [block, below of=identify] (evaluate) {a};
        \node [block, left of=evaluate, node distance=3cm] (update) {placeholder};
        \node [decision, below of=evaluate] (decide) {flowchart};
        \node [block, below of=decide, node distance=3cm] (stop) {sample};
        % Draw edges
        \path [line] (init) -- (identify);
        \path [line] (identify) -- (evaluate);
        \path [line] (evaluate) -- (decide);
        \path [line] (decide) -| node [near start] {?} (update);
        \path [line] (update) |- (identify);
        \path [line] (decide) -- node {!}(stop);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{A Flowchart sample}
    \label{flowchart_sample}

    \label{uic_landscape_picture}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Subsections}
Subsections are usually go to second or third levels in depth. This is heading 2 section.
\subsubsection{Heading 3 section}
This is heading 3 section.
\subsubsection{More sections}
If there are more sections, it is not suggested that more numbering levels are used. We can use the following way in give the fourth level section.
\subsection{\LaTeX~Functionality Demo}
\paragraph{Math Equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\displaystyle 1+
    \frac{1}{\displaystyle 2+
    \frac{1}{\displaystyle 3+x}}} +
    \frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{3+x}}}
\end{equation}


\section{Fonts and Format and Binding}
The font is Times New Roman. The font size for text is 12 pt. The font size is 16 pt for heading 1 and 14 pt for heading 2. The main text must be justify-aligned. The left, right margin is 2 cm around and the top, bottom margin is 2.5 cm around. The students should prepare two hard copies, one is sent to the supervisor, and anther is sent to the FYP coordinator. Besides this, each student should also send a soft copy to supervisor.\cite{Gusfield:97}\par

\section{Reference, Citation and Conclusion}
Each thesis must offer the references materials in the end. For all the references, they are supposed to be cited somewhere in the thesis.\\
The work in the thesis should be summarized and put in the conclusion part.\cite{APA:83}
